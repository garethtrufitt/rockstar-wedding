Well, because we don’t film them. You do! <br><br>We found that people are most likely to be silly, show off their best (or worst) dance moves and leave lovely messages for you if they’re relaxed and what better way to put everyone at ease than to get your own friends and family to capture the best moments? Plus, they know who the important people are and are there for all the best moments. So, relax, enjoy yourself and let your wedding be captured from the best seat in the house!<br><br>You’ll have load of input before, we’ll speak to you about the music you like, get an idea of you as a couple.<br><br>We’ll send you some broadcast quality 4K cameras and give you lots of advice on how and when to use them. Then we’ll work our editing magic on your footage and turn them into an awesome wedding video!<br><br>Take a look around and if you like what you see, drop us an email, we'd love to chat to you.<br><br></p>
